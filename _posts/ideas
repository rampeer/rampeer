There is an inherent inalienable worth attached to each person. In my opinion, this rule does not apply to ideas.

Everyone can generate plenty of new cool ideas (or solutions to a particular problem) in a short amount of time. However, most of them won't be efficient or even good ideas. "Ideas" themselves do not have an effect on the real world, and they do not actually solve any problems. To do so, they have to survive a complicated and long process - these ideas have to be EXECUTED. It's not uncommon for a great idea to encounter a problem or unavoidable blocker during execution. Because of that, ideas themselves are of little value. You do not believe me? There are lists of hundreds of "billion-dollar" ideas. You can pick one and develop it. However, it's unlikely that you will be as successful as the list name implies. Billionaires do not have that amount of money because they have good ideas. EXECUTION of good ideas is what made them billionaires; it's the only thing that matters.

Therefore, all ideas are trash until proven otherwise.

And yes, yours too.
