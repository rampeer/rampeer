Define metadata about data storages, services, pipelines and business objects, and tie everything together.

Useful for documenting existing services, and designing new data architecture.
Helps answering questions "where does this data come from?", "do we have historical states of objects?", 
"should we make daily snapshot of a table, or stream update ", "what's the data retention policy", 
"how do we calculate this feature offline and online in a consistent manner", and other
fun questions that arise when deploying model to production.
