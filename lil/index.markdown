## LIL

A language that defines metadata about links between high-level domain model ("business logic") and 
its code implementation and infrastructural realization. Supporting tools are capable of:
- extracting this metadata from the code, configuration files, and databases
- automatically keeping metadata up to date with the implementation
- generating code based on the metadata

That's useful for:
- Documenting existing services. A person can trace already known general concepts
to actual implementation in code.
- Quick prototyping. Automatic code generation builds a project scaffold for you, alleviating the burden of writing
- Architecture and decision-making. Metadata provides information necessary to make optimal decisions on
code changes, database and stack choice, etc.
